- Emphasize natural, organic elements

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Optimization

- Use WebP format with JPEG fallbacks for best performance

- Provide appropriate sizes for different breakpoints:
  - Mobile: 320px-767px width
  - Tablet: 768px-1199px width

### Accessibility

- All images must have descriptive alt text
- Alt text should describe the image content, not just identify it as "chef photo"
- Consider how images appear to screen reader users

## Placeholder Images

Until professional photography is available, consider using:

- High-quality stock photos that match the brand aesthetic
- Temporary placeholder rectangles with appropriate aspect ratios
- Images that can be easily replaced without affecting layout

## File Naming Convention

- Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens
- Include size information if multiple versions exist
- Example: `chef-portrait-500x500.jpg`, `chef-hero-800x400.webp`
