## 2. Color Palette

| Color          | Hex     | RGB             | Usage                                      |
| -------------- | ------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Olive**      | #708238 | (112, 130, 56)  | Primary color; buttons, accents, headlines |
| **Terracotta** | #E2725B | (226, 114, 91)  | Secondary color; highlights, CTA emphasis  |
| **Bone**       | #F9F6EE | (249, 246, 238) | Backgrounds, whitespace, typography base   |

**Guidance:**

- Olive anchors the brand — steady, organic, professional.
- Terracotta adds warmth and vibrancy.
- Bone keeps layouts airy, approachable, and uncluttered.

## 3. Typography

- **Primary Font:** Serif (e.g., _Merriweather_ or _Cormorant Garamond_) for headlines — conveys warmth and craft.
- **Secondary Font:** Clean Sans-serif (e.g., _Lato_ or _Source Sans Pro_) for body copy — ensures legibility.

**Usage:**

- Headlines: serif in olive or terracotta.
- Body text: sans-serif in charcoal (#333).
- Avoid pure black for text; it can feel too stark.

## 4. Imagery & Textures

- **Photography Style:** Natural light, unpolished but clean. Shots of Emma cooking, fresh produce, and organized fridges.
- **Textures:** Inspired by olive skins, salt crystals, and wooden cutting boards. Can be subtle background patterns.
- **Do Not Use:** Overly staged stock photos, harsh lighting, or corporate kitchen imagery.

## 5. Voice & Messaging

- **Tone:** Warm, approachable, and clear.
- **Messaging Pillars:**
  1. **Flexibility** – “Book when you need, skip when you don’t.”
  2. **Transparency** – Clear pricing and process.
  3. **Care & Connection** – Food as a way to bring people together.

**Sample Tagline Ideas:**

- “Meals that feel like home.”
