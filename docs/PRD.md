# Olive and Salt Brand Kit

## Color Scheme

Olive and Salt’s color palette reflects freshness, health, and an artistic elegance. The primary brand color is an olive green – a muted, earthy green (e.g. #637B2F) that evokes natural freshness and wellness. This olive tone conveys stability and a connection to nature, ideal for a holistic culinary brand. The secondary color is a soft cream white (e.g. #FDF9F3), reminiscent of sea salt; this neutral serves as a clean background to signify simplicity, purity, and elegance. For an accent, a warm earthy tone like a gentle rust or terracotta (e.g. #ED7B58) is used sparingly to highlight calls-to-action or important information – it provides a vibrant yet harmonious contrast to olive green, adding warmth and artistry to the palette

. In addition to the core colors, a set of neutral grays is included for text and UI elements. For example:
A very light gray (#F7F7F7) for backgrounds and section blocks.
A medium gray (#969696) for secondary text or icons.
A dark charcoal (#333333) for primary body text and headings, ensuring high contrast on light backgrounds.
This defined palette should be used consistently across the site. Primary olive green is reserved for key brand elements (logo, primary buttons, links, and accents like iconography or section headers). The cream/white background maintains an airy, clean feel (ample negative space), reinforcing a fresh and minimalist aesthetic. The accent rust/terracotta may appear in hover states, highlights, or decorative illustrations to draw attention without overpowering the calm greens and whites. Overall, the colors aim for a natural, inviting look: green for freshness and health, balanced by neutral simplicity and pops of warm creative flair.
Typography
Typography combines elegance with readability, mirroring the brand’s artistic yet approachable voice. We use a serif font for headlines and a sans-serif font for body text, a pairing that conveys sophistication while remaining highly legible. For example, headings might use Playfair Display (or a similar elegant serif) with a fallback to Georgia, serif, to imbue an upscale, creative feel. This type of serif has balanced, humanist letterforms that feel inviting and warm (indeed, fonts like Lora – a modern serif – are known to create an “inviting atmosphere” and convey warmth in hospitality contexts). For body copy and interface text, a clean sans-serif like Open Sans or Helvetica Neue is recommended (fallback to Arial, sans-serif). Sans-serif fonts ensure clarity and modern sensibility; for instance, Helvetica is famously neutral and easy to read, keeping focus on content. The sans-serif body text complements the decorative serif headers by providing contrast and excellent legibility on screens. Font Stack Example:
Headings: "Playfair Display", "Times New Roman", serif
Body Text: "Open Sans", "Helvetica Neue", "Arial", sans-serif
Both font families should be used in a limited number of weights (e.g. regular, bold for the sans; regular, semibold for the serif) to maintain consistency. The tone of the type should match the brand voice – for example, headlines could be set in Title Case or Sentence case (avoiding all-caps to keep a friendly tone). We avoid overly ornamental or overly geometric fonts that might clash with the brand’s approachable elegance. Instead, the serif provides a touch of classic, artistic flair, while the sans-serif ensures the overall look is clean and user-friendly. We also ensure proper fallbacks: if the custom web fonts fail to load, users will see standard fonts (Georgia or Arial) that still preserve a similar feel. Typography is sized according to a modular scale for visual harmony – for instance, using a “Major Third” scale as a guideline for heading sizes to maintain a smooth typographic hierarchy. Body text remains around the base 16px (1rem) for comfort. This typographic system as a whole reinforces Olive and Salt’s identity: elegant yet accessible, artistic yet clear.
Iconography
Our iconography follows a minimalist, outline-style aesthetic that aligns with the brand’s clean and elegant look. Icons are presented as simple line art: thin strokes, no heavy fills, and minimal extra detail. This outline icon style feels modern and artistic without being visually overwhelming. For example, service icons (a chef’s hat, a dinner plate, a leaf/herb, etc.) might be drawn with uniform line weights, open shapes, and sufficient whitespace. The consistent line weight and unfilled style ensure that the icons appear as a cohesive set throughout the site. The iconography’s style is also intentionally friendly and approachable. By using a clean, thin line style, the icons complement the brand’s warm personality and holistic theme without clutter. All icons will use the brand colors or neutrals for consistency – for instance, an olive-green line icon on a white background for a subtle branded touch, or white icons on an olive background for contrast. We avoid using multi-colored or highly detailed illustrations for small icons, as those can clash with our elegant simplicity. Key guidelines for icons:
Consistency: All icons share the same line style and approximate size. They are usually kept around 24px or 32px in size (with scalable SVGs for retina clarity) and padded with sufficient whitespace so they don’t feel cramped.
Simplicity: Each icon should use the fewest lines necessary to convey the idea (e.g., a fork and knife for dining, a heart or apple for healthy eating). Icons lean on universal symbols that users recognize instantly. This ensures quick comprehension at a glance, aiding intuitive navigation.
Usage: Icons will appear alongside labels on buttons or in section headings (such as little decorative flourishes near section titles, list bullets, or within service cards). They should enhance comprehension and aesthetics, but never distract from text. We maintain accessible contrast for any icons (e.g. olive green icon on white has good contrast), and include descriptive alt text or aria-labels for screen readers if the icons convey important info.
Overall, the iconography adds a subtle artistic flair (hand-drawn feel through line art) while staying consistent with Olive and Salt’s elegant, clean design language. It reinforces the brand’s personality by being unfussy, modern, and friendly – much like the brand voice.
Tone and Brand Voice
Olive and Salt’s brand voice is warm, personalized, and inspiring, striking a balance between professional expertise and friendly approachability. In every piece of copy, whether it’s a tagline on the homepage or an error message on the booking form, the tone should consistently reflect a persona that is: friendly, helpful, and approachable (much like a supportive guide in the kitchen). We speak to our audience in a conversational tone – as if the personal chef is talking directly to the client with genuine enthusiasm for improving their well-being through food. Key characteristics of the voice:
Warm & Caring: As a personal chef focused on holistic healthy cooking, the tone is nurturing and empathetic. We often reassure and encourage. (This aligns with a “Caregiver” archetype voice – warm, empathetic, and nurturing
brandsthatpunch.com
.) For example, copy might say “I craft each meal with care and your unique needs in mind” – emphasizing care for the client’s health and satisfaction.
Personal & Inclusive: Use of second person (“you/your”) and an inviting, inclusive language makes clients feel the service is truly bespoke. The voice celebrates individual preferences and needs (“Whether you’re vegan, gluten-free, or a devoted carnivore, we’ll create dishes you’ll love.”). The language avoids jargon and instead uses relatable culinary terms and vivid descriptions to draw readers in.
Knowledgeable & Holistic: While friendly, the voice also carries an underlying expertise in nutrition and culinary arts. It educates gently, sharing tips or ingredient benefits in an accessible way. For instance, blog or content might include helpful notes (“Quinoa is a great source of plant protein – we sneak it into a delicious salad you’ll enjoy!”) in a tone that is informative yet approachable (never lecturing). This positions the brand as a wise friend or guide (akin to a “Sage” but tempered with warmth).
Creative & Passionate: The brand’s artistic side comes through in imaginative descriptions and a sense of joy in cooking. We use sensory words and creative metaphors (e.g. referring to spice blends as “culinary color palettes”). This embodies a bit of the “Creator” archetype – imaginative, artistic, and innovative in how we talk about food
brandsthatpunch.com
. The voice conveys passion: Olive and Salt loves what it does, and that excitement should spark the client’s excitement.
Elegant yet Simple: We maintain professionalism and a touch of elegance in phrasing, aligning with the upscale service. However, we keep sentences straightforward and positive. For example, instead of a dull “We provide personal chef services,” we might say “Enjoy gourmet meals crafted just for you, in the comfort of your home,” which is both elegant and clear. The tone is optimistic, polite, and confident but never stuffy.
In practice, all written materials – from headings to button labels – should follow these tone guidelines. Contractions (“we’re”, “you’ll”) are welcome to keep the speech natural. The brand avoids negativity or fear-based messaging; instead of “Don’t eat unhealthy takeout,” we’d frame it positively: “Savor healthy, home-cooked meals without the effort.” We also incorporate the brand values (freshness, health, personalization) into the messaging consistently. By adhering to this voice, Olive and Salt’s communications will consistently feel like they’re coming from a friendly personal chef: one who understands your needs, cares deeply about your health and happiness, and adds a dash of creativity and delight to every interaction. This consistent tone builds trust and makes the user experience feel personal and welcoming across the entire site.
Mission and Values
Mission: “To enrich our clients’ lives with fresh, wholesome, and personalized culinary experiences. We bring the joy of healthy, restaurant-quality meals into your home, crafting each dish with creativity, nutrition, and care.” This mission highlights Olive and Salt’s commitment to nutritious, delicious, and satisfying meals made from fresh, high-quality ingredients, tailored to each individual – all without compromising on taste or artistry. It speaks to transforming clients’ daily eating into something nourishing and delightful, embodying both personal touch and holistic wellness. Vision: (Implied by mission) To redefine healthy home dining by making personalized, chef-crafted meals an effortless and cherished part of everyday life. In the long term, Olive and Salt aspires to be a leader in holistic personal chef services, known for elevating wellness through culinary art. Core Values: These guiding principles reflect what Olive and Salt stands for and inform all branding and design decisions:
Freshness & Quality: “Farm-to-table freshness in every bite.” We are committed to using fresh, seasonal, and high-quality ingredients. This means shopping local and organic when possible, and ensuring ingredients are of the best quality for flavor and health. Every recipe starts from scratch – no processed shortcuts – reflecting integrity and excellence in our craft.
Health & Wellness: “Nourish the body, nurture the soul.” We believe in the power of wholesome food to improve well-being. We design meals to meet specific dietary needs or health goals, proving that healthy eating can be delicious and enjoyable. Preservative-free, balanced nutrition is a must in our cooking philosophy. We stay up-to-date with nutrition knowledge and adapt to new healthy cooking techniques (e.g. plant-based options, anti-inflammatory ingredients) to best serve our clients’ wellness.
Personalization: “Your taste, your lifestyle – our menu.” Every client is unique, and we celebrate that by tailoring menus to individual tastes, dietary restrictions, and preferences. From favorite flavors to cultural cuisines or dietary plans (vegan, gluten-free, keto, etc.), we customize each experience. We value open communication to truly understand what each person or family needs, ensuring choice is always available and clients feel heard.
Creativity & Artistry: “Culinary art that tells your story.” Cooking is seen as an art form at Olive and Salt. We value creativity in menu design, presentation, and flavor pairing. The brand strives for an elegant and artistic aesthetic in every dish – plating is thoughtful and beautiful, and menus often introduce clients to new ingredients or global inspirations. We continually experiment and innovate (new recipes, fusion of cuisines) to keep the experience exciting. This creative passion also extends to how we present ourselves (our website’s look & feel, our writing style) – all should inspire and delight.
Warmth & Professionalism: “Service that is friendly and refined.” We treat clients like family, building relationships on trust, empathy, and reliability. We value professionalism – punctuality, cleanliness, organization – while remaining very personable and friendly in all interactions. Essentially, we bring a warm, caring attitude (you can trust us in your home and kitchen) coupled with the high standards of a professional chef. We take responsibility for delivering an exceptional experience every time (from prompt communication to leaving a spotless kitchen after cooking).
Sustainability: “Good for you, good for the planet.” (Optional value) We respect the environment by minimizing waste (composting, using reusable containers when possible) and sourcing sustainably. We aim to support local farmers and choose organic, ethical ingredients, aligning healthy cooking with a healthy planet.
These values are not just words – they inform design elements and copy throughout the site. For instance, Freshness and Health might be highlighted by images of vibrant produce and mention of nutrition, Personalization echoed in testimonials about custom menus, Creativity shown in artistic food photography and elegant fonts, and Warmth/Professionalism conveyed in the friendly yet polished tone of text and easy site usability. The Brand Kit and the website design will continuously reflect and reinforce these core values, ensuring a cohesive brand story.
Design Rules and Aesthetic Guidelines
To maintain a cohesive and beautiful user experience, Olive and Salt adheres to a set of design rules. These rules ensure consistency in how elements look and behave across the Angular-built site, creating an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interface. 1. Layout & Spacing: We use a 8px base grid system for all spacing and sizing, meaning margins, padding, and component dimensions are generally multiples of 8 (with 4px as a half-step when needed). This 8pt grid approach brings a harmonious rhythm to the design, as every element aligns to a consistent vertical and horizontal grid. For example, standard section padding might be 64px (8×8) on desktop, and smaller on mobile, but always maintaining the base increment. We also apply the internal vs external spacing principle: generally, components have a bit more space outside than the padding inside, so that groupings are visually clear. White space is generous to give that clean, open “modern cookbook” feel, and to let content breathe (no crowded text or images). A consistent spacing scale (8, 16, 24, 32...px) is documented and used in CSS throughout, avoiding any arbitrary gaps. 2. Color Usage & Contrast: The brand colors are applied systematically. The primary olive green is used for interactive and emphasis elements: primary buttons, links, active menu items, icon accents, and section headings or overlays that need a pop of brand identity. The secondary cream/white dominates as background for sections and page backgrounds, keeping the overall appearance light and fresh. The accent terracotta is used for attention-drawing details like notification badges, hover states on certain links or secondary buttons, or small decorative elements (e.g., an underline flourish on titles). We ensure all text has sufficient contrast against backgrounds for readability – primarily, body text in charcoal/dark gray on light backgrounds (meets WCAG AA contrast). In cases where text or icons appear on an olive background (e.g., a button or overlay), they are rendered in white or a very light neutral for contrast. This consistent use of color helps users quickly identify interactive elements and keeps the aesthetic unified and accessible. 3. Typography Scale & Hierarchy: We define a clear typographic scale for headings, subheadings, body text, and smaller UI text. Heading levels (H1 through H4, for instance) follow a modular scale (Major Third, roughly 1.25–1.3× progression) to ensure hierarchy is visually apparent. For example, if body text is 16px, H3 might be ~1.3× that (~21px), H2 ~1.6× ( ~26px), and H1 ~2× (32px), etc., adjusted as needed for balance. Headings are typically set in the serif font with a slightly subdued olive green or charcoal color, and body text in sans-serif dark gray. We maintain generous line-heights (e.g., 1.5 for body text) given the health/wellness theme – text should feel welcoming and easy to read, not cramped. Consistent letter-spacing is applied: generally normal for body, and slightly tightened for large display text to avoid a too-loose look (a few percent negative letter-spacing on huge headings can add polish). We avoid too many text styles; emphasis is by using the brand accent color for links or small highlights, italicizing quotes or mission statements, and using bold sparingly for key points. All of this creates a readable and harmonious typography system aligned with the brand’s voice (elegant yet friendly). 4. Buttons & CTAs: Buttons are designed to be prominent and easy to tap, following a consistent style. The primary button style (used for main calls-to-action like “Book Now” or form submissions) features a filled olive green background with white text for high contrast. Buttons have a medium border radius (around 4px) to slightly soften their appearance without overly rounded “pill” shapes – this matches our balance of modern (mostly rectangular) with friendly (soft corners). Padding follows the spacing scale; e.g., a standard button might have 12px vertical and 24px horizontal padding, giving it a substantial, clickable feel. On hover or focus, primary buttons change subtly: e.g. a slightly darker green or a drop-shadow appears to indicate interactivity (we prefer a subtle shadow lift on hover to add depth, aligning with our shadow guidelines below). Secondary buttons (for less critical actions) might use an outline style: olive green border and text on a white background, turning solid on hover or with a lighter accent fill. All buttons use a consistent font (sans-serif), medium weight, in sentence case text. They include a small icon if appropriate (e.g., an arrow icon on a “Learn More” link button) for visual cue, with the icon also following line style. The button styles are documented as part of the design system so that any new buttons in Angular components use the same classes. Overall, buttons should clearly stand out and invite clicks, using brand colors and medium rounded corners to look friendly and clickable. 5. Form Inputs and Fields: Form elements (inputs, textareas, dropdowns, etc.) are styled to be user-friendly and consistent with the overall design. Inputs typically have a simple border or underline in a neutral light gray, which turns olive green on focus to highlight the field in use. The shape of input boxes mirrors the button style – we use the same border radius (4px) on text fields and textareas to maintain consistency. Padding inside fields is generous (e.g. 8px vertical padding in a text input) for comfort and to accommodate the larger line-height of our body font. Placeholder text is in italic or a lighter gray, and labels are clearly visible (either above the field or as floating labels) in a sans-serif font. We ensure form controls are large enough for touch (at least 44px height) and spaced out (using the 8px grid for margins between form rows). Form validation messages, when shown, appear in the accent color or a red (if using red for errors) with clear, friendly wording. For example, if a user leaves a required field blank, an error might say “Please enter your name so we know what to call you!” – aligning with the warm tone. The design includes subtle feedback like a checkmark icon or green outline for valid fields after user input, making the process feel encouraging. Overall, from the styling to the microcopy, forms aim to be approachable and easy to use, reducing any intimidation of filling out information. 6. Cards and Panels: Olive and Salt employs card-style containers for grouping related content such as service descriptions, testimonials, and gallery items. These cards share a unified look: a white or light-neutral background, a slight shadow for depth, and rounded corners (larger radius, e.g. 8px, since cards are bigger components). The shadow is kept subtle (e.g., a soft drop shadow with slight offset and blur) to just lift the card from the background without heavy contrast – as one guide suggests, a “subtle shadow to raise interactive components and add affordance” is often enough. On hover (for interactive cards like a gallery image or a clickable service panel), the card may elevate with a more pronounced shadow or a slight upward motion, signaling interactivity. Within each card, content is laid out with consistent padding (typically 16px or 24px internally). For example, a Service Card might contain an icon or image at top, a heading (service name), a brief description, and perhaps a small link or button (“Learn more” or “Book this”). Text inside cards follows the typography rules (serif for title, sans for description). We maintain consistent spacing between elements inside the card (using the grid), so every card looks uniform in structure. The visual design of cards is meant to be clean and uncluttered: plenty of whitespace, maybe a faint divider line if needed to separate elements, and the use of our palette in a balanced way (e.g., icon in olive, heading in charcoal, link in accent color). This makes scanning multiple cards (like a list of services) comfortable and aesthetically pleasing. Cards help chunk information into digestible pieces, which is great for users and responsive design (cards can stack on mobile). They align with the brand by being elegant (through typography and white space) yet friendly (through soft shadows and rounded edges). 7. Imagery Style: Photography and imagery play a crucial role in conveying freshness and artistry. Olive and Salt’s images (e.g., food photos, chef portrait, ingredient shots) share a coherent style: bright, natural lighting (to showcase the vibrant colors of fresh food), slightly warm tones (for an inviting feel), and composed in an artistic, appetizing way. We might use shallow depth of field (blurry backgrounds) to give a professional, high-quality look. All images are displayed with either straight or subtly rounded corners (if rounded, we use the same border radius as cards to keep consistency). We do not use heavy filters – authenticity is key, so the food looks real and delicious. Where possible, images include a bit of the brand accent colors (for example, a dish might include green herbs or terracotta-colored ingredients) to subconsciously tie into the palette. We also consider diversity in imagery: a mix of close-up food shots, tablescapes, and occasional lifestyle photos of the chef cooking or clients enjoying meals, to tell a story. In terms of UI, images often are presented in galleries or as background banners with text overlay. When used as backgrounds (like a hero image), we ensure sufficient contrast for overlaid text, using overlays or choosing images with areas of neutral background. The imagery should consistently evoke fresh, healthy, and gourmet impressions, supporting the brand values of freshness and creativity. 8. Iconography & Graphics Usage: Custom icons or small illustrations follow the outline style noted above. We ensure icons are always aligned vertically with text when used as bullet points or in buttons (using proper baseline alignment via CSS). Icons typically appear in olive or dark gray, and on hover or active states might shift color (e.g., an icon in a link might turn terracotta on hover as a nice interactive cue). We may also incorporate subtle graphic elements like hand-drawn style separators or pattern backgrounds (for example, a light olive watercolor wash as a background shape in a section, or a pattern of herbs) to enhance the artistic vibe. These are used sparingly and consistently (perhaps as part of the brand motif) so as not to clutter the clean design. Any such patterns would be in soft tones of the palette and possibly reused across the site (e.g., a faint olive branch pattern in the footer background). These additions give an artisanal touch that differentiates the aesthetic, aligning with holistic and artistic branding. 9. Shadows and Depth: Depth is used subtly to indicate interactivity and hierarchy. As mentioned with cards and buttons, we define a few shadow styles for consistency:
Level 1 (Subtle Raise): A light shadow for default state of cards/interactive containers, just enough to separate from background.
Level 2 (Hover or Active): A deeper shadow when a user hovers on a card or focus on a button, to show it’s clickable (e.g., translateY(-2px) and a slightly larger blur shadow to “lift” it).
Level 3 (Modals/Overlays): A stronger, more spread shadow for overlays like a modal dialog or dropdown, to ensure it stands out above the page content.
We avoid extremely dark or long shadows; all are soft-edge, appropriately blurred, and often with a touch of the base color (like a faint olive tint) for a custom feel. Consistent use of these predefined shadows helps keep the UI feeling cohesive and ensures we don’t have ad-hoc shadow styles (preventing an inconsistent look). 10. Interaction and Motion: Interactivity should feel smooth and responsive. We employ CSS and Angular animations to enhance usability:
Hover and Focus States: All interactive elements (links, buttons, cards) have clear hover/focus styles (color changes, shadows, underlines, etc. as described) to give feedback. Focus outlines (for keyboard navigation) are visible and use the accent color or a distinct style to be accessible.
Page Transitions: Because this is an Angular single-page application, we can leverage Angular’s Router animations to animate route changes. We plan to implement gentle page transition animations – for example, a fade transition or slide effect when navigating between major pages, using Angular’s built-in high-level animation functions for route changes. This will make navigation feel more seamless and “app-like,” reducing jarring changes. The transitions will be quick (~300ms) and smooth, without delaying content load.
Scrolling Animations: As the user scrolls, elements may animate into view to add a dynamic feel. For instance, on the homepage, each section (services, testimonials preview) could fade in or slide upward as it enters the viewport. These animations are kept subtle and triggered once, to avoid distraction. They serve to draw attention to content in a gentle way. All motion is tuned to be purposeful and not overly distracting – e.g., using ease-in-out timing so movement is soft, and avoiding any obnoxious bouncing or flashing.
Loading States: If any data or images take time to load (gallery images, for example), we incorporate loading indicators (like a simple spinner or a skeleton placeholder using brand neutral colors) to keep the experience polished.
Feedback Animations: Small animations will provide feedback for user actions – e.g., when a form is submitted successfully, the submit button might morph into a checkmark icon or a success message slides down smoothly. If there’s an error, an error message might fade in with the accent color. These touches make the site feel modern and responsive to user input.
By following these design rules, we ensure that every page of Olive and Salt’s website feels like a part of the same brand family. Consistency in spacing, color, typography, and interactive behavior builds an intuitive UI where users can focus on content and not be distracted by design quirks. The overall effect we aim for is a website that is beautiful, artistic, and welcoming – much like a well-plated dish, it’s visually delightful without sacrificing function. All these guidelines will be documented for the development team, so that as the site is built out in Angular, components adhere to the Brand Kit specifications.
Shared UI Components
Across the Olive and Salt site, several key UI components and design patterns are reused to create a sense of continuity. These shared components are designed according to the Brand Kit specs above, and they appear on multiple pages as consistent modules:
Header & Navigation: A persistent top navigation bar with the Olive and Salt logo, menu links (Home, About, Services, Book, Testimonials, Gallery, Contact), and possibly a CTA button (e.g., “Book Now”). It uses the primary color for the logo/active link highlights and a clean sans-serif for links. On scroll, it may become a sticky header that slightly changes (e.g., shrinks or adds a drop shadow for clarity). This ensures users can navigate easily from any page.
Hero Banner: A large full-width section at the top of pages like Home (and smaller hero banners on inner pages). It usually includes a high-quality background image (e.g., a table of fresh ingredients or the chef in action), a concise headline and subheadline that communicates the page’s key message, and a call-to-action (like a “Book a Chef” button on the Home hero). The hero component uses overlay techniques to keep text legible (dark overlay or blurred background) if needed. The hero is a common component setting the visual tone on each page.
Call-To-Action (CTA) Section: A prominent banner typically placed towards the bottom of pages (or mid-way on long pages) that invites the user to take the next step. For example, after listing services, a CTA strip might say “Ready to savor a custom meal at home?” with a “Book Your Chef Now” button. These sections usually have a distinct background (possibly the accent color or a soft image) to stand out, bold text in our heading font, and the primary button style. They often utilize an eye-catching layout – e.g., a short line of text and a button, possibly alongside a small graphic like a line icon or a decorative flourish. CTA components are uniform across the site, reinforcing conversion opportunities.
Service Cards: As mentioned, the site uses cards to represent each service offering (like Personal Meal Prep, Private Dinners, Event Catering). The ServiceCard component includes an icon or photo at top, the service name, and a brief description. It may also include a small “Learn more” link or booking prompt. These cards are used on the Home page (to summarize services in a grid) and in detail on the Services page (each service might have a slightly expanded card or its own section). Keeping a consistent design (icon style, typography, size) for service cards helps users compare offerings easily. They typically link into the Book page or a contact action for that specific service.
Testimonial Slider/Card: Testimonials appear in two formats: a slider on the Home page highlighting a few key client quotes, and a full list on the Testimonials page. The Testimonial component contains a quote text, the client’s name (and possibly a small portrait or initials), and maybe a subtitle like the type of service or date. On the home page, a slider/carousel rotates through several testimonials (with a smooth fade transition), allowing social proof to be seen without taking too much space. On the dedicated page, multiple testimonial cards might be laid out in a grid or column with a bit more detail. Each testimonial card is styled consistently: perhaps italicized quote text (to set it apart), quotation mark graphics, and maybe a star rating graphic if appropriate. Consistency here means every testimonial is easily recognizable and legible. Real client first names and last initials (or full name with permission) are used to add authenticity. This component reinforces trust across the site wherever used.
Gallery Grid/Lightbox: The Gallery page uses a Gallery component that can also be reused for any image grids (for instance, maybe a mini-gallery on the About page showcasing dishes). This is essentially a responsive grid of image thumbnails (all cropped to a consistent size or aspect ratio for neatness). The Gallery component includes a lightbox feature: clicking an image thumbnail opens a modal view of the full photo (with dark overlay background, navigation arrows to move to next/prev, and a close button). We’ll likely leverage an Angular lightbox library or component to implement this for smooth performance. The gallery images can have captions (e.g., “Spring Salad – Avocado, Citrus, Almonds”) to act as a visual menu of our cuisine. This component emphasizes the brand’s visual storytelling – enticing viewers with beautiful food imagery. The same lightbox system can be used if we have a “portfolio” section or want to show larger versions of images anywhere on the site.
Contact/Booking Form: Forms are a critical component, used on the Book page and Contact page. Rather than create completely separate forms, we design a shared Form component with configurable fields. The booking form variant might include specific fields (date picker, service type dropdown, etc.), while the contact form variant is simpler (name, email, message). Both use the same underlying styles (as described in forms design): labeled fields, olive focus states, and validation messages. We use Angular’s Reactive Forms for these components, which gives us a robust way to handle dynamic validation and form state. For example, the date picker for booking could be an Angular Material component integrated into our form. The form component also includes the submission UX (loading indicator on submit, success message). By reusing a form component, we ensure consistency in how inputs behave across the site (the user doesn’t have to relearn interactions on different pages).
Navigation Footer: A site-wide footer that appears on all pages, containing quick links, contact info, and possibly a newsletter signup. It’s styled in the brand colors (perhaps an olive green background with white text for contrast, or a dark gray background to be subdued). The footer design ties into the brand (maybe featuring a small version of the logo or an olive branch graphic). It’s a consistent component ensuring each page feels complete and provides a path for further info.
All these shared components are built as reusable Angular components, meaning their design and behavior is defined once and used in multiple places. This not only ensures visual consistency but also improves development efficiency and maintainability. For instance, if we update the button style in the Button component, all CTA sections and forms automatically reflect the change. Each component is documented (in code and in this Brand Kit) for how it should look and function. Together, they form a coherent design system that makes the Olive and Salt website feel like a unified product. Users will appreciate that common elements (navigation, forms, buttons, etc.) behave predictably, allowing them to focus on the content – learning about the delicious, healthy services on offer – without any friction.
