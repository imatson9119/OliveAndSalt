      <h2>My Culinary Journey</h2>
      <div class="story-grid">
        <div class="story-text">
          <p>
            With over 15 years of experience in professional kitchens and a
            Master's in Nutritional Science, I've dedicated my career to proving
            that healthy food doesn't have to sacrifice flavor. My journey began
            in France, where I trained in classical techniques, but it was my
            grandmother's garden in Northern California that taught me the true
            magic of fresh, seasonal ingredients.
          </p>
          <p>
            After working in Michelin-starred restaurants in San Francisco and
            New York, I realized my passion wasn't just for creating exceptional
            food‚Äîit was for sharing that experience with people in their own
            homes. There's something deeply personal and nourishing about
            cooking in someone's kitchen, understanding their preferences, and
            creating meals that become part of their daily joy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I founded Olive &amp; Salt in 2019 with a simple mission: to bring
            restaurant-quality, nutrition-focused cuisine directly to your
            table, prepared in the comfort and privacy of your own kitchen.

          Every ingredient has the power to nourish and heal. I carefully select

          Cooking is an act of love‚Äîfor the ingredients, for the craft, and most
          importantly, for the people who will enjoy the meal. This intention
          infuses every dish I create.

        <h2>Why "Olive &amp; Salt"?</h2>
        <p>
          The name Olive &amp; Salt represents the foundation of all great
          cooking‚Äîquality ingredients and perfect seasoning. Olive oil, pressed
          from ancient trees, symbolizes the connection between tradition and
          nourishment. Salt, the earth's gift to flavor, represents the
          essential elements that transform good ingredients into extraordinary
          meals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, they embody my approach to cooking: simple ingredients,
          expertly handled, with respect for both tradition and innovation.
          Every dish I create starts with this fundamental understanding that
          great food comes from great ingredients, treated with care and
          intention.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you invite me into your kitchen, you're not just hiring a
          chef‚Äîyou're welcoming a philosophy that honors the sacred act of
          nourishing those we care about.
